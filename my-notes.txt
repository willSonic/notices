Notes

1) Notifications whether from upper or lower case should appear above the app on right side for now
   > Switch views /uppercase to /lowercase should not automatically remove notification
   > Notification should last 30 seconds before being gracefuly eliminated and removed from ui and store
	 > Notification should indicate origination /uppercase or /lowercase
	 > Notification should indicate type Success or Error
	 > Notification should include x close
	 > Notification should include messaging

using redux-observables

Redux Approach
Redux Observables
1) set up effect to Catch Http Response
	    --> Create Notification,
			     define Model
					 define Type
					 define ID uuid
		  --> Dispatch Action to Store and Add Notfication Collection
			-->	Dispatch Action to Remove Notification after Set Time Period ( .delay operator)
			--> Dispatch Action to Remove Notification manually

		  --> whether Manual or Automatic transmission of Action will arrive in sequential order to the reducer
		        which should enable me to check if the  notification is still present in the store
		        before attempting to delete it

		 create test between  remove Notification by time and manually SEE https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/recipes/Cancellation.html


2) Notifications should

Questions

1) Should we store a collection of the error messages, and then when it reaches specific capacity flush the cache

2) Should I do this both with redux-observables and redux-thunks

3) Should I include reudx-thunk and redux-observable testing and enzyme testing
